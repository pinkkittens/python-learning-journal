So far, I learned about the structure of programs
Package>Class>Method>Statement>Expression>Token
Token=building blocks
Expression=combination of tokens/building blocks
Statement=instruction to execute
Method=a function that belongs to a class, ie. class=dog, method= bark()
Class=definition that includes name and age, and methods
Package=a collection that is organized together, structures code into manageable pieces

#Arithmatic Operators
+
-
/
*

#Logical Operators
greater or less than signs
greather than or less than + equal to
equal = #the assignment operator
equal equal == #the equivalence operator

Statements
print ("Hello, World!")

Variables
x = ?
exampleVariable
name = 'John Doe'
age = 30

Variables are CASE sensitive
